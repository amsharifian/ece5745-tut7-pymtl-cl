ECE 5745 Tutorial 7: PyMTL Cycle-Level Modeling
==========================================================================

This repository contains the code and documentation for ECE 5745 Tutorial
7 on using PyMTL for cycle-level modeling. Most students are quite
familiar with functional-level (FL) and register-transfer-level (RTL)
modeling from ECE 4750, but students are often less familiar with
cycle-level (CL) modeling. This tutorial reviews the CL models for the
sort unit and GCD unit from ECE 5745 Tutorial 3. The tutorial also
explores a new CL model for a simple cache, and discusses a sophisticated
CL modeling framework used to model complex superscalar out-of-order
processors.
